# Assets Loading

Charts come with built-in dynamic asset pre-loading. Location of the assets is normally detected automatically. Unless you have moved the asset folder to other location, charts would work out of the box.

If you have moved asset folder to external location, you have to specify configuration parameter `settings.assetsUrlBase` to point to your custom location.
