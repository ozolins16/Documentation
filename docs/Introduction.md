# Introduction to BoomCharts

## What is Boomcharts

BoomCharts is a JavaScript/HTML library that helps you add visually rich and interactive charts to your application. With only a minimal amount of code you can visualize your data and let your users discover new insights.

You can use BoomCharts with any server side programming language (including .NET, PHP, Java, Ruby etc.) and with any client side framework (including AngularJS, jQuery etc.).

## Acquire BoomCharts

The simplest way of acquiring BoomCharts is to use the library directly from our CDN server:

```js
<script src="https://cdn.zoomcharts-cloud.com/1/stable/zoomcharts.js"></script>
```

Please see [installation section](http://localhost:3000/docs/introduction) for details on how to retrieve specific versions from CDN.

Also note that although the CDN is hosted on Azure CDN service (provided by Verizon) , we do not guarantee any SLA for its availability. To mitigate this you can download any version from the CDN server as a [zip archive](http://localhost:3000/docs/introduction) to host on your own servers.

**Note! In production environment do not use CDN as the source of library. Keep in mind that such versions such as `latest`, `nightly` or `stable` can change any time. To avoid some unexpected changes you should download your local copy of ZoomCharts. And upgrade to newer version whenever you have tested that on your development environment.**
